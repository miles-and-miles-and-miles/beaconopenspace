<h2>What is Open Space?</h2>
<p>"The term <b>open space</b> refers to land that is not intensively developed for residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional use. Open space serves many purposes, whether publicly or privately owned, and can include parks, recreational sites, scenery, trails, forests and woodlands, wetland and stream corridors, rare or important habitats, farms, and historic properties."
