<h2>Natural Resources Inventory: 2018–2020</h2>
<p>A team of volunteers, led by the City of Beacon Conservation Advisory Committee, and supported by elected officials and the City Administrator published the <a href="https://beaconny.gov/index.php/2020/07/07/city-council-approves-natural-resources-inventory/">Beacon Natural Resources Inventory (NRI) in June of 2020. The publishing of this document represented two years of work, including boots on the ground research into many parts of Beacon in order to determine their natural resources. The project was supported by the DEC's Hudson River Estuary Program staff as well as staff from Cornell Cooperative Extension Dutchess County who created the maps for the project.</p>

<h2>Open Space Inventory: 2021–present</h2>
<p>Immediately following the completion of the NRI, Conservation Advisory Committee volunteers sprung into action to move to the next phase of open space protection - the Open Space Index. </p>
