<h2>Natural Resources Inventory: 2017–2020</h2>
<p>A team of volunteers, led by the City of Beacon Conservation Advisory Committee, and supported by elected officials and the City Administrator, published the Beacon Natural Resources Inventory (NRI) in June of 2020.</p>
<p></p>The publishing of this document represented three years of work, including boots on the ground research into many parts of Beacon in order to determine their natural resources. The project, which recieved external funding, was supported by the DEC's Hudson River Estuary Program staff as well as staff from Cornell Cooperative Extension Dutchess County who created the maps for the project.</p>
<p>Concurrent with this work, <a href="https://ecode360.com/7066347?highlight=steep&searchId=6499434676235448#7066347">§ 223-16 Wetlands and watercourses; hilltops, ridgelines and steep slopes</a> was adopted, as was <a href="https://ecode360.com/32377069?highlight=fishkill%20creek&searchId=6499516404033139#32377069">§ 170-5 Rules applicable to Fishkill Creek Greenway Heritage Trail (FCGHT)</a>.</p>

<h2>Open Space Inventory: 2021–present</h2>
<p>Immediately following the completion of the NRI, a volunteer team sprung into action to move to the next phase of open space protection - the Open Space Index (See: <a href="https://miles-and-miles-and-miles.github.io/beaconopenspace/osi/">What is open space?</a>). They started with a survey of Beacon residents in order to find out what areas meant the most to them.</p>

<p>Energized by the survey results, project team members were eager to apply for grant funding to hire a consultant to complete the Open Space Index (OSI). They reached out to community members and trusted advisors with knowledge of and experience in open space planning and land management who agreed to provide feedback on the project. The volunteer team moved forward with planning an application to secure funding through the <a href="https://dec.ny.gov/nature/waterbodies/oceans-estuaries/hudson-river-estuary-program/grants-funding-opportunities">Hudson River Estuary Fund</a> after communicating their plans to the Mayor and the City Administrator and receiving verbal approval to move forward.</p> 
<p></p>However, when the time came to apply for funding, the Mayor and City Administrator told the team that the City did not have capacity to manage a grant.</p>
<p>A compromise was suggested. The team could develop their own list of high-priority parcels (in spite of the Mayor previously stating this was too much to ask of volunteers - see the 20 minute mark of the <a href="https://vimeo.com/754299211">September 26, 2022 City Council workshop</a>), creating the official OSI that would then be considered and adopted by City Council. While this represented substantial additional work - for a project that was likely to receive external funding, were an application to be submitted - the team agreed to the revised proejct plan due to the importance of the work.</p>
<p>After an open call for volunteers in late 2023, a project team was formed. The team has met regularly - with the knowledge of the Mayor and City Administrator - from early 2024 until today.</p>
<p>However, a new wrinkle has emerged. The Mayor has clearly stated that he does not intend to adopt the Open Space Inventory, a project that has had immense support from Beacon community members, support from City Councilmembers and the Mayor in , and represents years of volunteer labor. This is a particularly crushing blow, as it comes at a very late stage of this project's progress, when the work is all but complete, and we are tantilizingly close to being able to raise the profile of parcels within Beacon that have a high-conservation value, thereby increasing their protections as open space moving forward.</p>
