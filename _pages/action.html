<h2>How can you help?</h2>
<p>If you believe in the protection of open space in Beacon and you live, work, or recreate in Beacon, please <a href="https://beaconny.gov/index.php/government/city-council/">reach out to your Ward's City Councilmember, and/or a Councilmember At-Large</a>. Let them know that you support the official adoption of the Open Space Inventory (OSI) by the Beacon City Council, and do not consider spot-zoning changes to protect high-priority parcels to be enough.</p>
<p>Thank you for believing in the power of open space and for telling Beacon's elected officials how important and valuable it is to you, and how crucial its protection is for Beacon.</p>
