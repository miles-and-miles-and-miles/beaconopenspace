<h2>What is Open Space?</h2>
<p>"The term <b>open space</b> refers to land that is not intensively developed for residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional use. Open space serves many purposes, whether publicly or privately owned, and can include parks, recreational sites, scenery, trails, forests and woodlands, wetland and stream corridors, rare or important habitats, farms, and historic properties."</p>

<h2>Open Space Inventory and Index</h2>
<p>"Terminology used in local open space planning in New York originates from <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/GMU/A12-F">NYS General Municipal Law Sections 239-x and 239-y</a>, which direct Conservation Advisory Councils (CACs) to create an <b>open areas inventory and map</b>. Different terms are sometimes used by municipalities, but the purpose of an open areas inventory is the same--to identify open spaces with conservation, historical, or scenic significance, and list them in priority order for acquisition or preservation. Once the inventory and map are approved by the local legislative body, they become the municipality's <b>open space index</b>. The CAC can then become a conservation board and more formally participate in land use reviews affecting areas in the index."</p>

<h2>Open Space Plans</h2>
<p>"Once priorities are identified, mapped, and described, an <b>open space plan</b> outlines the best options for use and protection of those priorities, and lays out a plan for action with clear recommendations. Acquisition is only one mechanism for meeting open space goals; examples of other approaches include zoning updates, designation of critical environmental areas, revegetating stream and wetland buffers, and connecting recreational trails. For communities pursuing conservation financing through a <a href="https://hudson.dnr.cals.cornell.edu/conservation-planning/conservation-financing">Community Preservation Fund</a>, a <b>community preservation project (CPP) plan</b> must be adopted. The CPP plan is similar to an open space plan, but has specific content and process requirements outlined in <a href"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/GMU/6-S">NYS General Municipal Law Section 6-s</a>."</p>
